lapply  - loop over a list or vector.  Object will be coerced to a list if possible.  always returns a list.
sapply  - simplify result.  if possible, will simply into a vector, otherwise it will return a list.
apply   - apply over margins of array.  this takes an addition required field.  int, which is your row/column/dim
tapply  - apply over subsets of a vector
mapply  - multivarate versioni of lapply
